# Anki 2.0.x coloured ease buttons

This is an add-on for Anki 2.0.x in which I tried to improve the style of the ease buttons (Again, Hard, Good, Easy) and change their colours to match those of AnkiDroid. The ugly dotted outlined when a button has the focus is replaced by a yellow glow around the button :

This add-on is not compatible with Anki 2.1, but I will try to update it as soon as possible when the final version of the new Anki is released.

Tested in Anki 2.0.51 on Windows and 2.0.50 on Linux (Fedora).
